# Signatories
<!-- 
This section provides the ISC with a view of the support received from the community for a proposal. Acceptance isn't predicated on popularity but community acceptance is important.  Willingness to accept outside input is also a good marker for project delivery. 

An optional section would be for R-Core signatories where changes to R are proposed.
-->

We do not have formal signatories, but we are excited by the reaction and feedback from the R community following our "initial release" of the [lterdatasampler](https://lter.github.io/lterdatasampler/) package on Twitter. We point to engagement with, and responses to, our [twitter thread announcing the package](https://twitter.com/allison_horst/status/1513546784005521412). Selected comments include: 

- "Words cannot even express how clutch this will be for teaching environmental #rstats!" (Cassie Burbisz, Associate Professor, St. Mary's College)
- "Amazing! This will be part of my Global Change Biology course next spring!" (Caitlin Hicks Pries, Assistant Professor, Dartmouth College)
- "What an awesome resource! Integrating into my environmental policy and natural resource management classes." (Kristin Olofsson, Oklahoma State)

While we understand that these representative comments are not a substitute for official signatories, we feel that they highlight the need and support for this type of educational resource in data science education.

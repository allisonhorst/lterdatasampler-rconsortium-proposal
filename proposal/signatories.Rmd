# Signatories
<!-- 
This section provides the ISC with a view of the support received from the community for a proposal. Acceptance isn't predicated on popularity but community acceptance is important.  Willingness to accept outside input is also a good marker for project delivery. 

An optional section would be for R-Core signatories where changes to R are proposed.

We do not have formal signatories, but we are excited by the reaction and feedback from the R community following our "initial release" of the [`lterdatasampler`](https://lter.github.io/lterdatasampler/) package on Twitter. We point to engagement with, and responses to, our [twitter thread announcing the package](https://twitter.com/allison_horst/status/1513546784005521412). Selected comments include: 

- "Words cannot even express how clutch this will be for teaching environmental #rstats!" (Cassie Burbisz, Associate Professor, St. Mary's College)
- "Amazing! This will be part of my Global Change Biology course next spring!" (Caitlin Hicks Pries, Assistant Professor, Dartmouth College)
- "What an awesome resource! Integrating into my environmental policy and natural resource management classes." (Kristin Olofsson, Oklahoma State)

Additionally, we presented on an earlier version of the project at the useR! 2021 conference. During our session _[Teaching R and R in Teaching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8XZSuY_Rs&list=PL4IzsxWztPdmHhzrXDAOpq4zS_peAVty2&index=6)_, we received enthusiastic feedback from the participants about the project.

We understand that this informal feedback is not a substitute for official signatories. However, we feel that it highlights the need and support for this type of educational resource - curated and ready-to-teach datasets - in data science education.

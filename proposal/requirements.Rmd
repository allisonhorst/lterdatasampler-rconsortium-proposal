# Requirements
<!-- 
An idea of what is required to make the project actually happen
-->

## People

Proposers (Horst and Brun) are the primary authors of the `lterdatasampler` R package, and are currently the sole developers. 

Non-financial support is provided by the LTER Network Office, LTER Education Committee, LTER researchers and site Information Managers. 

## Processes
<!-- 
What processes need to be put in place e.g. codes of conduct, regular ISC meetings, handover to the community at large?
-->

We have established a system for communicating with LTER Information Managers, leadership, and researchers to gather feedback on package datasets and vignettes. 

Still needed are: 

- A more thorough "How to contribute" guide, so that we can incorporate (or link to) external contributor's examples as the data samples get used in different and interesting ways
- Feedback from the R community (particularly educators and learners who are using the `lterdatasampler` package), which we intend to gather through an informal survey (likely a Google form)

## Tools & Tech
<!--
What is going to be needed to deliver this project? 

Will cloud computing be used - if yes are there are necessary components that will be deciding factors between providers?

Are there tools or tech that don't exist that will be produced to facilitate the project?
-->

We will continue to build out `lterdatasampler` using the same tools and reproducible workflow that we have established in the [existing version](https://github.com/lter/lterdatasampler) of the package.

No additional tools or tech are expected. 

## Funding
<!-- 
[TO DO] THE GUIDANCE IS PRETTY UNCLEAR, ESP IN LIGHT OF GABOR'S PROPOSAL VS AWARD SIZE



-->

Total funding requested: \$XXXXX

Budget: 

- \$XXXX: Allocated to Horst, as compensation for time spent expanding the `lterdatasampler` R package
- \$XXXX: Allocated to Brun, as compensation for time spent expanding the `lterdatasampler` R package

We justify the requested amount based on an approximate total time spent on each datasample of 12 hours (includes finding, curating, adding to package, documenting, creating a vignette, reaching out to and getting feedback from LTER scientists, etc.). The current package contains data samples from 8 (of 28) LTER sites. With 20 additional data samples needed to complete `lterdatasampler`, we estimate a total of 240 hours required to complete the package. 

## Summary
<!--
A summary of the requirements that contextualises the costs
-->

We request the funding above (\$XXXXX total) to directly support developers Horst (\$XXXX) and Brun (\$XXXX) as salary for their time and effort spent expanding the `lterdatasampler` package for R educators and learners.

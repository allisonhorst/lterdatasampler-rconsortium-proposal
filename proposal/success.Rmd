# Success
<!-- 
Projects should have a definition of done that is measurable, and a thorough understanding going in of what the risks are to delivery 
-->

## Definition of done
<!-- 
What does success look like? 
-->

The `lterdatasampler` is available on CRAN with 28 data samples and teaching examples. Along the development process, data science instructors have started to integrate data samples in their curriculum and workshops **NEED TO QUANTIFY THIS MORE**

There is a documentation online of the process to contribute to the package to enrich the available portfolio of examples and tutorials using the package.

## Measuring success
<!-- 
How will we know when success is achieved, what markers can we use along the way 
-->

## Future work
<!-- 
How could this be extended / developed in the future by yourself and/or the community in general?
-->



## Key risks
<!-- 
What sort of things could come up that can delay or break the project?

 - [ ] People
 - [ ] Processes
 - [ ] Tooling & Technology
 - [ ] Costs

-->

We can not provide all the 20 datasets within the timeline

The package becomes to large for a CRAN submission. One option could be to split the package in several ones.

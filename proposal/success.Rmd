# Success
<!-- 
Projects should have a definition of done that is measurable, and a thorough understanding going in of what the risks are to delivery 
-->

## Definition of done
<!-- 
What does success look like? 
-->

We envision a successful `lterdatasampler` R package as follows: 

- The `lterdatasampler` package is available on CRAN, with 28 data samples and teaching examples
- The `lterdatasampler` package data samples are adopted and used by instructors in data science education (classes, workshops, tutorials, etc.)
- Documentation online supports others to contribute to the package, which grows an enriching portfolio of examples and tutorials using the data samples that others can follow for teaching and learning inspiration

## Measuring success
<!-- 
How will we know when success is achieved, what markers can we use along the way 
-->

We plan to use the following to track success: 

- CRAN downloads as an indicator for package use
- Google analytics to track package website visitation
- Twitter engagement and tags
- A Google form, added to the `lterdatasampler` home page, requesting that educators and users provide feedback and recommendations, and share how they have used the package including links to any resources created using the data samples (e.g. tutorials, repos, data visualizations, course lessons, etc.) 

## Future work
<!-- 
How could this be extended / developed in the future by yourself and/or the community in general?
-->

We are excited to build out a "Community Portfolio" of examples and open educational resources that use the `lterdatasampler` package datasets. 


## Key risks
<!-- 
What sort of things could come up that can delay or break the project?

 - [ ] People
 - [ ] Processes
 - [ ] Tooling & Technology
 - [ ] Costs

-->

The key risks of this project include: 

- We are unable to complete the additional 20 data samples within the timeline

- The package size exceeds limits for CRAN submission. We are carefully choosing and crafting data samples in an effort to keep `lterdatasampler` in a single package. If we are unable to provide the enriching content we want in a single package, one option is to split the package into two parts, each with 14 data samples.

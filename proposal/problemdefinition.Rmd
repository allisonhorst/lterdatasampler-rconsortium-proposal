# The Problem
<!-- 
Outlining the issue / weak point / problem to be solved by this proposal. This should be a compelling section that sets the reader up for the next section - the proposed solution!

It is important to cover:

 - [ ] What the problem is
 - [ ] Who it affects
 - [ ] Have there been previous attempts to resolve the problem
 - [ ] Why it should be tackled
-->

Identifying, accessing, curating, and sharing datasets can be a huge time sink for data science educators and learners, which often (understandably) results in the overuse of stale or poorly documented datasets that lack real-world relevance (see: `iris`, `mtcars`, etc.).

# Project plan

## Start-up phase
<!--
Covering the planning phase, this section should provide a relatively detailed plan of how work will start on the project. This section is important because projects need to get up and running quickly.


 - [ ] Setting up collaboration platform inc. code for contributors etc.
 - [ ] Licence decisions
 - [ ] Reporting framework
-->

As we have already released the 8-data sample "teaser" of the `lterdatasampler` package, we feel that we have completed the "Start-up phase" and seek support to add the additional 20 data samples to complete the R package.  

## Technical delivery
<!--
Covering the actual delivery of the project this section should provide at least a high-level the implementation. 

Including target dates is really important as you need to be committed and the ISC need to have a means of tracking delivery
-->

We aim to complete the package by **June 2023**, at which point we expect to submit `lterdatasampler` to CRAN. 

## Other aspects
<!--
Covering non-technical activities like on-going publicity, paper preparation, discussion groups etc. that might be required to facilitate successful delivery of the project.

We have been actively working to publicize our initial release of the `lterdatasampler` package including through Twitter (see our [announcement thread](https://twitter.com/allison_horst/status/1513546784005521412)), a [blog post](https://lternet.edu/stories/ready-to-teach-r-environmental-datasets-the-lterdatasampler-r-package/), and several conference talks (e.g. at useR!2021, and ESA 2021). We plan to continue our media efforts to spread awareness and foster engagement with this new package.
